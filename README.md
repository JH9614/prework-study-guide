## Usage

This prework study guide can be used through out the course to refer back to and build onto, enhancing the student's learing capabilities. This saves the student from laboriously searching the internet for various useful informations by putting them all within the reach of the student from day one. To best use the study guide it is recommended that the student use the web development tool in their browser often when visiting the application. Within the development tool one can see the basic building blocks of most websites and can review the basics of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Apart from the web development tool there are sections listing the afore mentioned information that is going to be useful to the student through out the course.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
