# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This prework study guide was created so that students have a working example of code. It serves as a repository of the individual student's knowledge absorbed from the prework and serves as a study guide for the bootcamp.I learned how to link an HTML document to  external files such as CSS and JavaScript documents, how to print things to the console of the web developer tools in the browser, and how to use basic CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used through out the course to refer back to and build onto, enhancing the student's learing capabilities. This saves the student from laboriously searching the internet for various useful informations by putting them all within the reach of the student from day one. To best use the study guide it is recommended that the student use the web development tool in their browser often when visiting the application. Within the development tool one can see the basic building blocks of most websites and can review the basics of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Apart from the web development tool there are sections listing the afore mentioned information that is going to be useful to the student through out the course.
