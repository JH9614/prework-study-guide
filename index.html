        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains informatino about the webpage (meta data).</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user (semantic code).</li>

          <li>"Element" refers to the entire element. For example, from the opening to the closing of a semantic element.</li>

          <li>"Tag" refers to the letters or numbers held within the element brackets i.e. the "li" for the "list item" element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h4-headings">HTML Elements</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>"meta" is the tag used to place information in the head of the webpage so that the browser can use that information to render the page. The "meta" info is also useful for 
            SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
          </li>

          <li>"header" is a semantic html element that is used to introduce the webpage and provide a navigation menu.</li>

          <li>"main" is a semantic html element that is used to contain the core content of the page.</li>

          <li>"div" is the tag for the element that is used to create a container to group content so that it can be easily styled with CSS. 
            It does nothing semantic until it is styled. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"> Here's a link to an example of its use.</a></li>

          <li>"a" is the tag for" the "anchor" element. This element has many attributes that may be used with it, a link to a list of them is in the "href" list item. 
            When you click the link, just scroll down.</li>

          <li>"table" is the tag that is used to create a table feature in the web page. It has multiple distinct sub tags related to it.
            Two of those being the "thead", "/thead" and the "tbody", "/tbody". These are used to create the head and body of the table feature respectively.
            Sub to the previous two are the "tr", "/tr" the "th", "/th" and the "th", "/th". The "tr" is to create each individual row for the table. 
            The "th" is to create the headding for each column in the table. And finally "th" is to create the spot where the actual data goes (it stands for "table data").
          </li>

          <li>"form" is the tag that is used to create spaces where the webpage can ask users for information and the users can interact with the page by providing said information.
            There are several subtags that can be used with the "form" tag: 
            "label", "/label" to say which information you are asking for, <br> "input" ("input" elements are self closing) which is used with an attribute or two to declare the type of information that is going to be recieved
            (those attributes being "type=" and "name="), <br> "textarea" gives the user a larger space to input information (a section for user complaints for example), <br>
            "select" is used with the tag "option" to provide the user with choices (there is a single choice given for each "option" tag used), 
            "input" can be used to create a button within the form if you use the "type="submit"" attribute and value
            (example: sumbition button for when you're done filling it out). Each of these tags is to be used in conjunction with the attributes "type", "name",
             and "value" which are used to designate
            types of data thusly where the data will be sent and processed ("type"), how each of the categories are labeled for the end user ("value"), and adds a designation for a server side 
            program to grab onto ("name").
          </li>

          <li>"button" creates a button separate from a form or anything else. In order for the "button" element to actually do anything it needs to be connected to some sort of JavaScript.S</li>

          <li>"img" designates an image that you would like to show on the web page, it has to be used with the "src=" attribute to find the designated image.
            It should also be used with the attribute "alt=" which makes it so if the image doesn't appear for some reason, you atleast know what was supposed to be there
            (this also helps with Search Engine Optimization). Example: "img src="some.url" alt="some image" " The "img" element is self closing.
          </li>

          <li>"Blockquote" is used mainly for quotes and creates padding around a set of text. This uses an attribute called "cite=" which is used to show the source of the quote.
            It only shows the citation material in the source code. 
          </li>

          <li>"abbr" is used to show the non abbreviated form of something that is abbreviated when you hover over the abbreviated material. It does this when used in conjunction with 
            the attribute "title=". The abbreviation is placed between the beginning part of the element and the end, like in the anchor element ("a").
          </li>

          <li>"cite" is the tag that is used to italicize bits of info to show that that info is being cited as a source for a set of info on the webpage.
            It is semantic to let the browser know that that source material is being cited.
          </li>

          <li>"figure" lets you associate an image with a caption. To use it properly you have to nest an image within the "figure" element and then use the next element on the list.</li>

          <li>"figcaption" adds a caption to an image.</li>

          <li>"fieldset" adds a sectioned of portion to the webpage.</li>

          <li>"textarea" has the same properties as an "input" element with the "type" attribute "text", but you can put more text into it and can do multiple lines of text. This element
            requires a closing tag. To enlarge the "textarea" element, use the "row" and "cols" attributes which affect the height and length respectively.
          </li>

          <li>"span" is a generic inline container used to designate a bit of text or part of a document for mark up with css more easliy.</li>

          <li>"legend" is used to create a caption for the content of its parent filedset element.</li>

          <li>"fieldset" is an element that is used to create a visually separate space from the rest of the webpage. It functions as a visual container, so-to-speak. </li>

          <li>"label" is used to semantically denote a "form" sub/child element and should always be explicitly linked with the input that it labels. This is done by giving the "input" an "id"
            and then giving the "label" a "for" attribute that is identical to the value of the "id".
          </li>

          <li>"caption" is an element that is used to caption "table" elements. It must be the first child of each respective "table" element.</li>

          <li>"thead" is the element that creates the header section of a "table" element.</li>

          <li>"tbody" is the element that creates the main portion of the "table" element that will hold most of the information.</li>

          <li>"tr" is the element that creates a row in a "table" elemnt. In order to use it you have to nest it inside a "tbody" or "thead" element, which its self will be a child of the "table"
            element.
          </li>

          <li>"th" is the element that creates a data cell within the "tr" element, so naturally it is a child of the "tr" element when in application.</li>

          <li>"th" is the element that creates a header cell for each data cell.</li>

          <li>"i" is used to make text idiomatic (separated from normal text). This could be used for italic text like scientific terms, or for icons.</li>

          <li>"code" is the tag for the "code" element and is used to assist in writing text that deals with computer code. If you use the "code" element, the text will display as a snippet
            of computer code rather than just general text.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h4-headings">HTML Attributes</h4>

        <ul>

        <li>GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES: These are attributes that can be used with all HTML element. 
          Any element in this list will have a (GA) by the statement of its tag to show that it is one.</li>

        <li>"charset" is an attribute that is used to tell the browser how to render the lettering and numbers on a page.</li>

        <li>"action" is used to specify where form data from a webpage will be sent to the server when submitted.</li>

        <li>"method" is used to specify how to send form data from the webpage to the server. 
          For example: "method="get" makes it so form-data can be sent via a GET request. Same can be done for a POST request.
        </li>

        <li>"content" is an attribute typically used in a "meta" tag. It can be used to tell the browser how to fill the screen with the page. 
          Example: "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" " is how you tell the browser to fill the *whole* screen of any device with the web page.</li>

        <li>"href" is the tag for an attribute that is generally only used with the "anchor" element. 
          The href attribute allows a link to be connected to a bit of text or an image, etc. that is contained within the "anchor" element.
        <a href="https://html.com/attributes/a-href/">Here is a guide to its use and some examples.</a></li>

        <li>"target" is an attribute that can be used with the "href" attribute within the anchor (has the "a" tag) element, to open a link in a new window. To do this you need to give it 
          a value of "_blank".
        </li>

        <li>"type" is used with the "input" element and shows what type of data the browser should expect. If it isn't specified the browser defaults to text. Different things can happen 
          on the webpage based on the type of data the browser is expecting.The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain.
          The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. 
          <br>
          To make a submition button, use the "input" element and specify the type as "submit". To add text to it that identifies it to the user give it a "value" of "submit".
        </li>

        <li>"required" is an attribute used to make an input required to fill out or activate to be able to submit a form. There is no value to be added to this attribute 
          so it doesn't have an equal sign with quotes.
        </li>

        <li>"minlength" is an attribute that is used to ensure that a password has atleast a certain number of digits.</li>

        <li>"pattern" is used to specify a given pattern that is provided in its value portion. Ex: 
          <br> 
          [a-z0-5]{8,}.

          Given, is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.
        </li>

        <li>"name" is used to specify a name for an html attribute and can be used to reference the element for JavaScript. It can show that two radio/checkboxes/other are related so that you
           can't check both at the same time if you give them the same name.</li>

        <li>When using form elements like "label" and "input" or "select"+"option" you need to link the label with the actual form with attributes "for" (used in the label element)
          and "id" used in the "input" or "select"+"option" tags.
        </li>

        <li>"class" is used to give an element a designation that can be used to target it with a css selector. The designations given by "class" attributes are typically not unique to that
           element. You can use multiple words with spaces between to enable targeting of that element by different css rules at the same time. Example: "<"div"> class="big text""" </li>

        <li>"id" is used to give an element a unique designation that can be used to target it with a css selector.</li>

        <li>"content"  is an attribute of the "meta" element and is used to set the meta information in an HTML document.
           This can be the information for the description or the keywords, for name attribute.  </li>

        <li>"rel" shows the relationship between a linked resource (page/picture/css file) and the current document.</li>

        <li>"role" is an attribute that is used to define the purpose for an element which is useful for assistive technologies. It's part of the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative).
          Example: "section role="region /section".

        </li>

        <li>"aria-labelledby" is an attribute that identifies an element that is being used to label another element. For example, you can use a heading to label a section with "h2", id it
          as "someid" and then in the parent element you can use the "aria-labelledby" attribute to refer to that by giving it the same value as the id.
        </li>

        <li>"aria-hidden" is an attribute that indicates that the element and all of its children are to be hidden from the user and screen readers but readable to the browser.</li>

        <li>"placeholder" is an attribute that is used to show that you can type in a text box. When the user starts typing, the text disappears. Using this is not best practice though, as the user
          can confuse the "placeholder" text as an existing input and believe the section is already filled out.
        </li>

        <li>"accesskey" is an attribute that is used to link keyboard shortcuts to the webpage. Their use is not always advised.</li>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <h4 class="h4-headings">HTML 5 Semantic Tags/Elements</h4> 

        <br>

        <p>

          There are different tags/elements that are used to construct a layout of a website. Their meaning and use is self evident for the most part.

        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>

          <li>"header" creates a header for the webpage which can contain a title for the page, logo, social media links and other such things.</li>

          <li>"footer" creates a footer for the webpage which can contain links to other resources, help pages, licensing information, etc..</li>

          <li>"aside" creates a section off to the side of the web page's other main body sections ("section" and "article") and could contain side bar content. </li>

          <li>"section" is where the main content of the site goes (as I understand it)</li>

          <li>"article" goes underneath the "section" and can contain further information like things from your blog.</li>

          <li>"nav" contains the navigation bar for the website (not the webpage because you don't need to navigate to a page you're already on). It is placed just below the header and above
            the "section" and "aside" parts.</li>

          <p>If you want a colored border for an element you have to use css, first to set the width of the border then the color. Every element has a an innate border from the start.</p>

          



        </ul>
    
    </section>
    
    <section class="card" id="css-section">

      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is what is used to decorate a webpage</li>

        <li>CSS tags don't require any type of bracket around them for them to qualify as a rule (element equivolent in CSS).</li>
          
        <li>To use CSS simply state the tag (what's inside an HTML element's brackets) of the HTML element and any attributes added to that CSS element will be applied to the HTML element.
          Any attributes added to a CSS element will be placed with in the confines of a set of curly brackets/braces ie. these things: {}.</li>

          <li>Rules in CSS can be applied to multiple different CSS elements at once. This is done by stating an element, adding a comma, then stating the next element. 
            This can be done with infinitely many CSS elements. 
            When the comma(s) has been added beween the CSS elements, the attribute(s) to be applied to them can be written like normal (like for a single element). 
            Be sure to place the separate CSS elements on different line (ie. row 68, then 69) to aid in legibility.</li>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>

        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>

        <li><a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">A collection of CSS resources for beginners.</a></li>

        <p>Within CSS there are some things that use units (like meters in physics).</p>

        <li>"vh" is one of these and it stands for viewport height. 1vh is equivalent to 1% of the height of the viewport. 100vh is 100% the height of the viewport.  </li>

        <li>"rem" stands for "root em" (root element) and relats the font size to the size of the root html element.</li>

        <li>"vw" stands for "view port width" and makes it so the specified element will only take up so much of the screen. For example, 60vw would make an element take up 60% of the screen.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS Elements (Called Rules), Declarations and Properties</h4>

      

      <p>Rules are used to designate/declare an element to apply changes to, properties are the changes that are applied. Selectors are the first characters with in a rule, they state which
        element you wish to affect with the css rule. If you want to target a child element within a parent element, first state the parent element then the child, separating them with a space.
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/anatomy" id="anatomyLink">An article about the anatomy of a CSS rule</a> </p>

      <ul>

        <li>Attribute selectors are what is used to select an html element based on a given attribute that it contains. For example, "input[name="password"]" is a css selector
          for any input element with the name "name="password" " attribute inside it.
        </li>

        <li>CSS elements are called "rules".</li>

        <li>The CSS selector is what could be considered the equivolent of an HTML tag. It is the declarative item that starts the "rule". 
          For example, to apply color to an HTML heading of size one (h1), the "rule" starts with the CSS selector "h1".</li>

        <li>"*" means "all elements". It applies its self to all semantic (means to be seen) HTML elements on an HTML document. 
          So if there are any attributes within this CSS element, those attributes will be applied to every HTML element in the HTML document.</li>

        <li>Class and id selectors can be used to select certain child elements within a parent element. 
          <br> This can be don by simply stating the class/id the element is attributed to and then (using a space to separate the two) stating the tag of the element that you wish to affect. 
          <br>Just like normally selecting a singular element.</li>

        <li>Inorder to use multiple class and Id selectors in a single rule, you have to separate each on by a comma AND a space.</li>

        <li></li>

      </ul>    

        <ul>

          

         


        </ul>

          <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS Properties</h4>

        <p>Properties in CSS are the parts of the CSS rules that make the rule do something. For example, if you wanted to make the background color for some html element black,
          you'd have to use the property "background-color" with in the CSS rule and set the property's value to black.</p>

        <br>

        <p>You can use parts of very specific properties as values with their respective shorthands. For example, "border-left-style" (chooses type of border) is a very specific property and cannot do the same thing as another,
          equally specific property such as "border-left-width" (chooses pixel thickness of border). To get around using multiple propertys you can use the  "border-left" property to 
          style and designate the width of the border at the same time.
        </p>


        <ul>

          <li>"margin" is a value that effects the distance from one element to another. It can be set with pixels or percentages (these percentages are measured by the distance from
            one end of the parent element to another as this can only affect child elements). When using the shorthand "margin" you affect all sides of the element ("margin-top",
            "margin-bottom", "margin-left", and "margin-right"). If you put two values in for the "margin" shorthand then the first value will effect the top/bottom and the second will do the 
            left/right. 
          </li>

          <li>"margin: 0 auto;" is a good way to center an element.</li>

          <li>"padding" again, indicates how much space you want on the inside of an element, this can produce the same result as using "margin" on a child element. "padding" is also
            shorthand that applies the value given to it to all "padding" derivitives ("padding-top","padding-bottom", "padding-right", "padding-left").
          </li>

          <li>"overflow" tells how things should be styled when content overflows the parent element box.</li>

          <li>"unset" can be used to get rid of a particular setting that you don't want for a specific element but is being applied globally for a page.</li>

          <li> "border-left-width" is used to make the left side of an element's border thicker than the other three sides.
          </li>

          <li>Changing the type of border (dotted, dashed, etc.) requires the use of the "border-left-style" property, which only styles the left side of an element's border to solid black by
            default.
          </li>

          <li><p>The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:

            box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;
            Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work:
            
            both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units
            a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
            a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
            if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change.</p></li>

            <li>Blur radius is another value of a shadow property. It blurs the edges of a shadow so that it LOOKS like a shadow. You enter a third variable value in the shadow to use this.</li>

            <li>Spread radius is another value of a shadow property/property that expands the footprint of the shadow. It is the fourth optional variable value in the shadow property.
              Like blur radius, spread radius defaults to zero if not specified.
            </li>

            <li>"display" specifies the type of rendering behavior (type of box model) of an html element. </li>

            <li>"flex-direction" is a property that changes how html elements are displayed. Example: "flex-direction: row-reverse;" will cause the elements to be displayed in reverse order
              in a row. "flex-direction: column-reverse;" will cause them to be displayed in a column in reverese order aswell.
            </li>

            <li>"flex-wrap" determines how "flex" items will behave when  they run out of room on the screen. Example: "flex-wrap: wrap;" will cause them to "wrap" into the next row or column.
              Whether it is a row or column they wrap into is specified by the "flex-direction" property.
            </li>

            <li>"justify-content" determins how items in a flex container are positioned along the main axis of the flex container. As in how it distributes space between
               and around content items along the main axis of a flex container and the inline axis of a grid container. Example: "justify-content: center;"
                moves everything to the middle of the webpage. Example: "justify-content: space-between;"  Distribute items evenly. The first item is flush with the start, 
                the last is flush with the end. So it will space out two elements as much as possible, one flush with the left side of the parent element and one flush with the right side
                of the parent element.
            </li>

            <li>"align-items" determins how items in a flex container are positioned along the cross axis of the respective element. 
              The direction of the cross axis is determined by the flex-box'a "flex-direction" property. Example: "align-items: center;" moves everything to the middle. 
            NOTE: in order to use this property the element its self that is in question needs to have been made/declared to be a flex container/flexbox.</li>

            <li>"filter" is a function that targets the applied element and can blur it. Example: "filter: blur(1px)" will blur the the element's pixels by one.</li>

            <li>"border-radius" is used to round the corners of a given element. Example: "border-radius: 9px". Different sets of corners can be altered different amounts by number placement.
              Example: "border-radius: 9x 2px;" where the first number alters the top left and bottom right corners and the second alters the top right and the bottom left corners. 
              This property can accept up to four values. Then the order is top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left.
            </li>

            <li>"border" is a property that allows you to customize the nature of the border of any element. For example, "border: 2px dotted #fff" will create a two pixel thick, white dotted line
              around any element.
            </li>

            <li>"border-(insert side here)-color" will change the color of the border on that specific side.</li>

            <li>"border-style" is a property that is used to designate the style of the border, like if you want it "solid" or not.</li>

            <li>"border-collapse" sets whether or not cells with in a table have their own borders or share them. The value "collapse" will make them share borders, while the value "separate"
              will cause them to have their own borders and a small space in between them.
            </li>
  
            <li>"box-shadow" is used to give an element the appearance of having a shadow. Example;"border-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px yellow".</li>
  
            <li>"transform" is a property that can be used to move an element in different ways like rotating the entire thing counter clockwise. Example: "transform: rotate(-0.6deg)"
              Note the negative sign for "counter".
            </li>
  
            <li>"object-fit" is a property that is used to make an "img" element to behave in a specific way. Example: "object-fit: cover;" will make the img element fill the container while 
              maintaining its aspect ratio, making it crop its self to fit. Use this to fix distorted pictures with in a container.</li>
  
            <li>"gap" is a css shorthand property that sets the gaps (aka gutters) between rows and columns. Example: "gap: 16px;" will cause a gap between columns and rows.
               It's sub properties are row-gap and column-gap. </li>

            <li>"font-family" is a property that is used to designate the desired font for a webpage. The font types can be listed with in the property. Any font name with a space in it 
              must be wrapped in quotes for css. Example: "font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif". 
            </li>

            <li>"font-size" is a property that is used to designate the desired font size for a webpage or selected element. The size can be given in units like pixels (px) or percentage of the
              given element.
            </li>

            <li>"font-style" is a property that is used to change how the font of a certain region of text looks. For example, you could use it to make the text italicized with
              "font-style: italic;"
            </li>

            <li>"box-sizing" is a property that specifies any box to have a specific value applied to it. Example: "box-sizing: border-box;" corrects the size of the box in the browser
               to the size of its borders, excluding the padding and thickness of the border.
               <br>
               You can extend this "box-sizing" property to all elements with "* {box-sizing: inherit;}". This makes it so the element inherits the display value of its parent.
            </li>

            <li>"font-weight" refers to the boldness of an element's text.</li>

            <li>"letter-spacing" is a property that can be used to adjust the space between each character/letter of text in an element.</li>

            <li>"width" is a property that can be used to scale an element to the desired width of its parent element or webpage. You can set a max width for a set of elements by declaring that
              element type and using the "width" property to set it. Example: "element {width: max(250px 20vw)}". "vw" = viewport width.
            </li>

            <li>"aspect-ratio" is a property that determines the aspect ratio of an element/image. Example: "aspect-ratio: 35 / 4;". Note the use of spaces between the numbers and the slash.</li>

            <li>"text-decoration" is a property that allows you to alter semantic textual elements. For example, you can get rid of an underline on a set of text by using "text-decoration: none".
              
            <li>"cursor" is used with ":hover" to change the cursor to something other than the mouse arrow when you hover it over an element. Example: "button:hover {cursor: pointer;}" will
              change the mouse arrow to the pointer hand.
            </li>

            <li>"top" is a css property that designates the distance a particular element is from the top of the page. If you want to make something stay at the top of a page you simply have to
              give this property a value of 0.</li>

            <li>"list-style" is a css property that allows you to directly change the styling of a "li" element. For example, if you want to remove the dots from an unordered list element,
              and replace it with nothing then you can just do "list-style: none;".
            </li>

            <li>"scroll-behavior" is a property that is used to change how links that are used to navigate the local page effect the screen of the user. Using the "smooth" value for this
              property makes the computer scroll to the linked section of the webpage instead of instantly jumping to that location as is default. This helps the user not to be disoriented. </li>

            <li>"caption-side" is a CSS property that is able to move the HTML "caption" elements around to their desired locations. The "caption" element is mainly for use with the "table"
              element.
            </li>

            <li>"clip" is a property that is used to define the visible portions of an element.</li>

            <li>"clip-path" sets a "clipping region" which determines which part of an element should be shown. Where parts inside the region are shown, parts outside aren't.</li>

            <li>"white-space" is a property that is used to change how white spaces inside an element are handled. For example, if there are lots of words in an element and you want to make them
              all be in one line instead of a multi-line paragraph you could use: "white-space: nowrap;". If you want them in a paragraph you use "whit-space: normal;"
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space">Click here to learn with a demo.</a>
            </li>

            <li>"position" tells whether an element should move from its original position either when the page is scrolled through or just passively by default. It can be used to cause an 
              element to "stick" to the top or bottom of the screen when scrolling past the element. For example, you would type this phrase to make it stick at the top of the screen when scrolling
              downwards: "position: sticky;", then "top: 0;". This will make the element stick at the very top of the screen with no gap between it and the edge, hence the "0".
              <br>
              Setting "position" to "absolute" allows you to take the element it's being applied to out of the top down rendering order flow and do with it what you want. Elements in html are 
              rendered in a top-down order, as in, if they are the first elements written in a parent then they will be rendered at the top of the parent. Using "position: absolute;" can change
              where on the page they appear. This is how the Free Code Cample put it: 
              <br>
              Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position property.

Set the position property for the #back-wall element to absolute. An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. Set the #back-wall element to have a top value of 0, and a left value of 0.
            </li>

            <li>"!important" is a VALUE that you can give to any property that you can use to make sure a rule is applied to an element regardless of execution order or specificity.
              For example, "position: absolute !important" is how you would write it.
            </li>

            <li>"top" is a property that allows you to say how close or far you want a child from/to the top of the parent. Example: 
              "top: -2.25rem" will move the child closer to the top of the parent the greater the size of the negative number, while a positive number will do the opposite.
              There are other properties that are just like this but they have to do with each respective side of the screen and are named accordingly. If you use a percentage with this 
              property, it will interpret the percentage as meaning "10% from the top of the parent element", and that's the same with all other "side designating properties".
            </li>

            <li>"vertical-align" is a property that is used to move a child element up or down within the parent element. For example it can be used to place text at the top of the parent
              with this: "vertical-align: top;". 
              <br>
              There is no "horizontal-align"?
            </li>

            <li>"z-index" is a property that is used to create layers for your HTML elements. I.e. a "vertical axis" by which they can be aligned, think z-axis like in math. 
              Elements with a higher "z-index" value will appear to be layered on top of other elements.
            </li>

            <li>"float" is a property that is used to move an element to the right or left of another element while making the other element wrap around it. The values that can be used 
              with this property are "left", "right", "none", "inherit". With "none", the element doesn't float, as in it will be displayed just as it occurs in the text or in relation to the 
              other elements in the parent.
            </li>

            <li>"content" is used to create or override the content of an element. Using this with pseudo-selectors ensures that they are rendered to the page but still empty if you give them
              "content: "" " as the property's value. Otherwise the pseudo-element will not be rendered to the page. Doing this with the "content" property ensures their rendering with no content.
            </li>

            <li>"box-sizing" is a property that can be used to affect the size of an element. When using "box-sizing" with the value "border-box" you make it so the border thickness doesn't effect
              the size of the element.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="h4-headings">At-rules/Media queries/Logicial operators</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>"@media" is a media condition that is also an at-rule that has a feature called "prefers-reduced-motion" which is used to modify CSS rules based on the user's preferences.
             It takes one of the following values:"reduce", and "no-preference". It is wrapped around an existing selector with the existing selector sort of functioning like the declaration
              part of the rule (property and property value). Example: 
            <br>
            <code>
            "@media (feature: value) {
              selector {
                styles
              }
            }"
            </code>
            <br>
            This at-rule is used to conditionally apply CSS. It is known as a media query. Media queries are usually used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the "max-width" and 
            "min-width" properties.
            <br>
            In the below example the padding is applied to the .card class when the viewport is 960px wide and below.

            @media (max-width: 960px) {
              .card {
                padding: 2rem;
              }
            }

          </li>

          <li>"and" is a logical operator that can be used to "query" two media conditions. Here is an example with the FreeCodeCamp's explanation:
            <br>
            Logical operators can be used to construct more complex media queries. The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.

For example, a media query that targets a display width between 500px and 1000px would be:
<code>
@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){

}
Add another @media rule to apply if the browser window is wider than 769px but smaller than 1199px.
</code>
          </li>

        </ul>
      
        <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS Color Methods</h4>

        <p>There are various ways to implement colors into your website with CSS. You can use the rgb/rgba value scheme, hex colors, hsl/hsla color functions, the hwb color function, named colors
          and transparent keywords. For better information refer to the projects in the feecodecamp css module "CSS Color Markers" steps 50 and onwards. </p>

          <br>

        <p></p>

        

        

        <ul>
          
          <li>Hex color code is a type of color designation that uses three sets of two figures that aren't separated by spaces or commas. Format: "000000". All zeros means black all f's means white.
            The first two figures are for red, the second are for green, and the last two are for blue.
          </li>

          <li>RGB color code is another way to designate colors. It is comprised of a set of three neumerical figures that are separated by commas and spaces. Format: "0, 0, 0". All zeros means 
            black. The highest value able to be put in each spot is 255, which maxes out the color that is added, so "255, 0, 0" would be as red as possible. All values set at 255 will make white.  </li>

          <li>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. It has three values that need to be filled out, the first one (hue) is just a number, the next two (saturation and lightness 
            respectively) are percentages. Format: "185, 16%, 50%". The "hue" designates the color that is to be used and the rest are descriptors detailing how much and how intense. 
          </li>

          <li>Color-stops are values that you put at the end of a functions color value ('linear gradiant (90deg, rgb (255, 0, 0) 75%) where the color stop is the percentage value). The way this 
          is written will make the color red occupy 75% of the spectrum that the property 'background' with the function 'linear gradiant' creates.</li>

          <li>Opacity is a property that is used to make things see-through.It is stated as a decimal value that equates to percentages. 0 is equal to 0% and 1.0 is 100%.
             The default for any element is to make it completely opaque (1.0).
          </li>

          <li>Alpha Channel: The Alpha Channel is another way to deal with opacity. When using it you add a name to the color function that you are using, namely "a". Example: "rgba". 
            Adding this extra "a" to the end of rgb adds a decimal value (that's equivalent to a percentage value) to the end of the function. Example: (0, 0, 0, 0.5). This can be used with
            hsl and hex colors (just adds another pair of figures to the end of a hex value just like the rest).

          </li>

          <li>Gradients are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. In other words a gradient creats a spectrum from one color to another within the bounds of an 
            element. They are applied to the "background" property and the syntax looks like this:
            <code>
            gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);
            </code> 
          </li>



        </ul>

      <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS functions</h4>

      <p>A CSS function is used within a property and is used to affect the way the value is displayed by the CSS property. For example: 'linear-gradient' is a function that can 
        be used with the property 'background' to change how the colors are displayed in the background of the element. It creates a spectrum from one color to the other and can only be used
        with two or more colors. The color values put in the function don't have to be a specific format, they just have to be colors that can be rendered.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>'linear-gradient' is a function that is used to create a spectrum from one color to another. You can choose how this spectrum is oriented with the gradient direction arguement (data piece).
          It can be oriented in any direction, left-right, up-down, or kitty corner based on whether you input anything from 0degs to 359degs (360 is the same as putting 0 because it's like a color wheel).
        </li>

        <li>"calc()" is a function that lets you calculate a value based on other values. For example, you can use it to calculate the width of the viewport minus the margin of an element:
          ".example {
            margin: 10px;
            width: calc(100% - 20px);
          }"
          This is good for running a webpage on multiple types of devices with different screen sizes because it automatically adjusts the elements to take up a set amount ("2px" or whatever) 
          of horizontal (only the case for this application) of the parent element.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS Variables</h4>

        <p>Variables always begin with two dashes and are given a name and value like this: "--variable-name: value;". Variables are placed within rules just like anyother property and can also
          be used as the values of other properties. Here is an example of one being applied: <code>background-color: var(--building-color1)</code> Note that there is no need for a semi colon at
          the end. In order for a variable to be used like this however, it needs to have been declared elsewhere as something like this: <code>--building-color1: #999;</code> this way when it
          is applied to another rule or property it already has a value so it works.
          <br>
          If you change the value of the variable where it is first declared, then it affects the rest of the places it is implemented."
          <br>
          If the variable doesn't work right away, you can give it a fallback value like green (doesn't need to be with colors of course). You just need to add a comma and a space between it
           and the variable name that is already in the parenthesis, like this: "someProperty: var(--variable-name, green);"
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li></li>

        </ul>

      </ul>

      <h4 class="h4-headings">CSS selectors</h4>

        <p>Selectors are basically just stating the tag of the html elements that you're targeting over again. Unless they are class, id, "*", or others.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Id selectors are just the name of the id proceeded by a "#" with no spaces.</li>

        <li>Class selectors are just the name of the class proceeded by a "." with no spaces.</li>

        <li>">" is a selector that is used to target a child element of a parent element. Example: "nav > ul {}". When targetting multiple elements inside a single parent element, state the parent
          twice and each child once. For example if you have a parent called ".info" and the children are "label" and "input" you do this: ".info > label, .info > input", or
          ".info label, .info input". Note the use of a comma in both declarations.
        </li>

        <li>Another way the ">" effect in CSS can be replicated to an extant by merely using the indivdual tags in their appropriate order of execution. For example, "A" is the parent element 
          of "B" so when you wish to specify "B" in the CSS rule's declaration portion, you merely have to first state "A" then "B" with a space in between.
          <br>
          To target a specific element and the rest of the elements in a parent with a CSS rule at the same time you can use something like this: "footer, footer a". Where "footer" is the parent
          and "a" is a specific child of that element. 
          <br>
          To target all elements, including psuedo-selectors you can use something like this: "*, ::pseudoA, ::pseudoB"
        </li>

        <li>To target any child element with a certain attribute, regardless of the attributes value you can use this syntax: "#years span[class]{}". The "span" is the type of element being targeted,
          the "class" is the type of attribute being targeted, and the "#years" the id of the parent.
        </li>

        <li>Targeting any element with a specific attribute that has a certain value can be done with a selector written in the format: 
          "elementTag[attribute="value"]". A specific example would be like this: "tr[class="total"]", where "tr" is the table row element, "class" is the assigned class attribute and "total"
        is the assigned class attribute's value. 
      <br>
          Taking that even further, you can target a child element within the parent with "parent[attribute="value"] child".
      <br>
      The key difference between "tr[class="total"]"" and "tr.total" is that the first will select "tr" elements where the only
       class is "total". The second will select "tr" elements where the class includes "total".
        </li>

        <li>Targeting elements with a one or more classes and using that same CSS rule to create/affect a psuedo element is done with this notation: ".class.class2::psuedoSelector{;}"
        </li>

        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php">More CSS selector notations can be found here.</a>Many of these selector notations are for selecting multiple elements
        or selecting elements based on their classes or id's.</li>

        <li>Selecting an element with a certain class that is its self inside a child element can take the form of something like this: "parent.parentclass child .child'sChildclass". 
          Here is the example used in the FreeCodeCamp course:

      <h4 class="h4-headings">Pseudo-selectors</h4>

      <p>A pseudo-selector is a keyword that specifies a certain state that the selected element can be in. For example, when a user hovers their mouse over a link that link can change color.
        The mouse hovering over the link is the state that is being reffered to, when it is in that state (possibly about to be selected) it changes color but only then for that specific
        pseudo-selector.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>":hover" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you hover your mouse over it.</li>

        <li>":active" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you click it.</li>

        <li>":visited" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color after you've used it.</li>

        <li>":after" is a psuedo-selector that creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. Example: ".gallery:after {}" is how you use it. When this psuedo-selector 
          is used it will create an empty pseudo-element that will not be shown in the webpage by default. If you want to be able to see the element then use the "content" property to make it
          show. If you want to keep the psuedo-element created by the psuedo-selector empty, then you can use the value of "" for the "content" propterty.
        </li>

        <li>":not" is a psuedo-selector that can be used to select all elements that don't correspond with a certain Id or class attribute. Ex: "div:not(#example) {}" will apply the css 
          properties the css rule contains to any element that doesn't have an Id of "example". </li>

        <li>":before" is a pseudo-selector that can be used to create a pseudo-element that is the FIRST child of the selected element. It's mainly used to add cosmetic content to an element
          by using the "content" property. This pseudo-element that is created is in-line by default. This pseudo-selector creates a psuedo-element that, by default, won't be rendered to the page.
          If you wish to render the psuedo-element to the page, then use the "content" property. Give the "content" property a value of "" if you wish for the psuedo-element to remain empty.
        </li>

        <li>":last-of-type" is a pseudo-selector that is used to target the last child in a parent element.</li>

        <li>":first-of-type" is a pseudo-selector that is used to target the first child in a parent element.</li>

        <li>":nth-of-type()" is a psuedo-selector that is used to target specific child elements within the parent based on their order among siblings of the same type.</li>

      <p>SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics is an image format that is used for two dimenstional images/graphics and has support for interactivity and animation.
        Scalable Vector Graphics contain a "path" attribute that allows the image to be scaled to the webpage without affecting the resolution of the resultant image. </p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>When in a terminal window, you can use the command "console.log()" (place any variable you wish to run inside the parenthesis) to run code you've already written.</li>

        <li>JavaScript is a widely used language that is used by websites to handle multimedia, animated images, and create dynamically updating content.</li>

        <li>JavaScript is also the code that links the front end to the back end (I think).</li>

        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. They use "labels" to point to the data rather than using the data its self. Any of the eight data types 
          can be stored in a variable. These variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different data at different times.
          <br>
          Variable names can contain numbers, letters, $ or _ but no spaces.
          <br>
          All variables and function names are case sensitive.
        </li>

        <li>Control flow refers to how the code we input is executed by the computer. 
          For JS the control flow is top to bottom and for multi faceted variables, functions, objects, arrays and the like, it is executed left to right.
        </li>

        <li>There are eight different JavaScript data types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.</li>

        <li>"strings" are a collection of text symbols/characters. These collections of characters cannot be used to perform mathematical operations, but singularly function as textual data.
          Strings must be denoted by beginning and ending the phrase/data with sets of double or single quotation marks. To use a literal quote in a string, place back slashes in front of the
          quotation marks associated with the quote so that the computer doesn't confuse the quote's quotation marks as the beginning or ending of the string its self. But this only applies
          to strings that use the same types of quotes at the begining and end and again in the middle. For example:
          <br>
          <code>const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";</code>
          <br>
          The back slash is just under the "backspace" button on the keyboard of your laptop.
          <br>
          The back slash being used inside of a string for continuity's sake is what's called an escape character. "Escape" as in it escapes a problem that would throw an error when the code is
          run.
        </li>

        <li>Single and double quotes work the same in JS so you can use them together. This makes it difficult to use apostrophies and the quote signs. To be able to use apostrophies and quotes
          you simply place a back slash infront of the apostrophy as an escape character.
        </li>

        <li>"escape characters" can be set up in "escape sequences" such as these: 
          <br>
          <table id="table">
            <tr>
              <thead>
                <th></th>
                <th>Code and</th>
                <th>Output</th>
              </thead>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\'</td>
              <td>single quote</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\"</td>
              <td>double quote</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\\</td>
              <td>back slash</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\n</td>
              <td>new line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\t</td>
              <td>tab</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\r</td>
              <td>carriage return</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\b</td>
              <td>back space</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>\f</td>
              <td>form feed</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
        </li>

        <p>Using the above characters in the proper sequences will cause the textual data within the string to return in a certain manner. For example, if you imbed the "\n" with in the string
          its self then it will return with a break in the string and everything after the "\n" will be on the next line down. If you use the "\n" and "\t" together (use them one after another
          with no spaces) your string will return as everything after the "\n" being on the next line but also indented thanks to the "\t" (the "t" is for "tab").
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>"concatination" is when you "add" two or more strings (or other data types) together such that the symbols that represent the data are put together into one piece of data. For example,
          if you concatinate two strings like "one" and "two", the concatination of those two strings will be "onetwo". 
          <br>
          Notice that absence of space between them, this is caused by the lack of a space 
          being present in either string.
          <br>
          A simple concatination would look like this: <code>const myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."</code>
          <br> 
          Which would look like this when run: 
          <code>"This is the start. This is the end."</code>
          <br>
          Another logical operator that can be used to concatinate strings is "+=", which would look like this: 
          <code>let myStr = "This is the first sentence. "
                myStr += "This is the second sentence."
          </code>
          Which returns those two strings concatinated.
        </li>

        <li>Constructing strings with variables is done by assigning a value to a variable and using it like a mathematical variable in a mathematical expression where the numbers are strings.
          For example, if you assign a value of "Josh" to an arbitrary vaiable like "myName" and then create another variable "myStr" you can use the format below to concatinate the multiple 
          strings together.
          <br>
          <code>
            const myName = "Josh";
            const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
          </code>
          <br>
          Thusly outputting  "My name is Josh and I am well!"
        </li>

        <li>"Appending" a variable to a string is about the same as constructing strings using literals. You just name the variable in the JS code instead of the variable's value. For example.
        <br>
        <code>
          const anAdjective = "awesome!";
          let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
          ourStr += anAdjective;
        </code>
        <br>
        This code will output "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"   
        </li>

        <li>Assigning value to a variable is done with a logical operator, namely "=". You can assign a value to a variable right after it is declared so that when ever the variable appears
          after it's declared it will be treated as that particular value. As in, if you give a variable the value of 7 then it will be treated as the numerical value of 7.
          <br>
          You can also assign the value of one variable to another simply by declaring both, giving one a value and making the value of the second the first variable. Here is an example:
          <br>
          <code>
          var myVar;
          myVar = 5;
          var myNum;
          myNum = myVar;
          </code>
          <br>
          It is also common to "initialize" a variable by declaring it and giving a value of 0. That way you can use commands to change its value later and not have to go back through and declare
          a new variable.
        </li>

        <li>The length of a string can be found using the ".length" property. For example:
          <br>
          <code>
            // Setup
            let lastNameLength = 0;
            const lastName = "Lovelace";

            // Only change code below this line
            lastNameLength = lastName.length;
          </code>
          <br>
          This code will return the length of the string "Lovelace" in a nuemerical format.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>JS terms</h4>

      <ul>

        <li>"Literals" are constant values that can be ascribed to variables. They're also called constants. </li>

        <li>"String literals" are the first parameter of a function, and any expressions interapolated into the string</li>

      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>JS declaration keywords</h4>

      <ul>

        <li>
          "var" is the one of the older keyword declarations that can be used. However, it does have it's problems, namely being that you can change/reassign its value too easily. For example, if you declare
          a variable like this "var person = Jon" and then sometime later declare the same variable with "var person = Beth" then the "person" variable will retain a value of "Beth" instead of
          "Jon" and this can screw up calculations and other data manipulations.
        </li>

        <li>
          "let" is another JS declaration keyword that is used to allieviate the above problem. When using "let" to declare a variable, that variable's value cannot be reassigned. So, "let person = Jon" won't 
          allow the variable's value to change to "Beth" if you write "let person = Beth" later. However, the variable's value can be changed/reassigned with different operations,
           just not new declarations.
        </li>

        <li>"const" is another JS keyword that can be used like "let" in that its declared contents cannot be reassigned in value. Attempting to do so will result in an error message in the 
          console. "const" is short for "constant".
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Numbers and logical operators JS</h4>

      <p>Numbers and their operators such as the addition sign and the multiplication sign ("*") are treated as they are in arithmetic0. There are also different uses for the mathematical 
        symbols than just math with in JS.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          "++" is an operator that is used to add one to an existing variable with a numerical value. It looks like this: "i++" which is equivolent to "i = i + 1".
        </li>

        <li>
          "--" is just the same as the above operator, but just the opposite as it deals with subtraction.
        </li>

        <li>
          "%" is the remainder operator. It gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. For example, if you write "5 % 2" it would return 1. If you wrote "5 / 2" then it would return 
          2 with a remainder of 1. This operator is often referred to incorrectly as the "modulus" operator, it is similar to the modulus operator but cannot handle negative numbers properly.
        </li>

        <li>
          " += " is an operator that conducts the addition of two numerical values or strings or what have you and assigns the result of the addition at the same time. You can use this to save 
          alot of typing. For example, instead of writing "myVar = myVar + 5" you can write "myVar += 5" to add five to the value of the variable.
        </li>

        <li>
          " -= " is the same as the above, just with subtraction.
        </li>

        <li>
          " *= " is the same as the prior two, just with multiplication.
        </li>

        <li>
          " /= " is the same as those prior, just with division.
        </li>

        <li>
          Decimals are often called "floating point numbers". These "floating point numbers" can also be stored in variables by simply assigning them to a declared variable. They can also be 
          used in operations the same as anyother number, but calculations on computers are "finite" so sometimes the results may be different than expected. "finite" refers to the space 
          the computer has on its memory (RAM) to do the calculation and that computers can only store decimals up to a certain length before they can no longer calculate the problem.
        </li>

      <h4>Bootstrap Notes</h4>

      <p>Bootstrap is a frontend framework that is used to make responsive webpages and apps. It uses a mobile-first focus to webdevelopment and has pre-built CSS styles and classes along with
        some JavaScript capabilities. 
        <br>
        Bootstrap a responsive 12-column grid system, making it easy to put elements into rows and designate each elements relative width. And most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a 
        "div" element.
        <br>
        There are different coloumn width attributes that Bootstrap uses depending on how wide the user's screen is (think phone vs PC screen width).
        <br>

      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>To use Bootsrap you have to link the bootstrap url to the page with:

         <code>  link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u"

        <br>
        <li>To use Bootstrap you have to implement the use of it's different classes in your HTML elements. Using the proper Bootstrap classes tells Bootstrap what do with the element that has
          them.
        </li>

        <li>"row" is a class in Bootstrap that makes all elements within the parent line up in a row from left to right on the screen.</li>

        <li>"well" is a class in Bootstrap that gives a visual sense of depth to your columns.</li>

        <li>"container-fluid" is a Bootstrap class that is used to make an element(s) "mobile-responsive", as in, it makes the element able to adapt to mobile screens.</li>
        
        <li>"img-responsive" is a Bootstrap class that is used to make an image fit exactly to the size/width of the screen.</li>

        <li>"text-center" is a Bootstrap class that is used to affect the placement of text elements within their respective parent elements.</li>

        <li>"btn" is a Bootstrap class that is used to designate something as a button so that Bootstrap can target it. So at the very least, you'll have to constantly use this class along with
          anyother Bootstrap class to use Bootstrap on a button.
        </li>

        <li>"btn-block" is a Bootstrap class that is used to make the button a block level element, shoving the rest of the elements in its row off down to the next one. Block level elements
          do not affect the page in a columnar manner.
        </li>
        <br>

        <p>There are a myriad of different colors that can be used with buttons in Bootstrap. </p>

        <br>
        <li>"btn-default" is a Booststrap class that is used to set the color of a button to "default". Note that these classes have nothing to do with designating the size of the button 
          so they'll conform to the size of the text that you give them.
        </li>

        <li>"btn-primary" is a Bootstrap class that is used to make a button the primary/main color that you will be using for the rest of the webpage.</li>
        
        <li>"btn-info" is a Bootstrap class that is used make button(s) a different color to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.</li>

        <li>"btn-danger" is a Bootstrap class that is used to make botton(s) a special color to warn users of destructive actions, like deleting a photo.</li>

        <br>
        <p>Note that the "primary", "info" and "danger" portions of the above classes can be used with classes that apply to other types of elements such as text elements. For example, 
          "text-primary" is a class that will change the color of the text it is used with to blue.
        </p>
        <br>

        <li>"col-md-*" is the syntax for a type of Bootstrap class which effects the width of an element within the 12 column Bootstrap framework. The "md" means "medium", for a 
          medium sized screen (like a laptop) and the place where the asterisk is is where the number specifying the number of columns the element should cover goes. 
        </li>

        <li>"form-control" is a Bootstrap class that can be applied to "input", "textarea", and "select" elements, making them have a width of 100% of their parent element.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Miscellaneous Notes</h2>

      

        <li>When dealing with images and you use the "width" CSS property, you don't really have to use anything else because the image will change to maintain its aspect ratio(?).</li> 

        <li>"position" is a CSS property that can be set to "relative" to make the original position of the affected element a point of reference for any changes.</li>

        <li>If you have trouble finding where and element is and what size it is, just set it's border to 1px solid black.</li>

        <li>To make the body element fill the whole html parent you can use css that looks like this: 
          <code>
          body {
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
          }
          </code>
          <br>
          If you want any element to fill the whole parent use this: 
          <code>
          .background-buildings {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
          }
          </code>
        </li>

        <li>To align items along the bottom of a parent that has been declared a flex container, use "align-items: flex-end;". Then if you want them evenly spaced, use
          "justify-content: space-evenly;".
        </li>
         <br> 
         <h4>Font Awesome</h4>
         <br>
         <li><p>Font Awesome is a library of symbols that can be treated as fonts when used on a webpage. With it you can utilize things like an "info circle" (a white circle with a letter "i" in it.
          And add things like thumbs-ups to buttons and other stuff. To use Font Awesome you need to link it in your HTML code with: 
          <br>
          <code><!--<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" 
            crossorigin="anonymous"> --></code>
         </p>
        </li>

        <li>To utilize Font Awesome, you need only implement the corresponding classes for the needed symbols into the appropriate elements. For example, if you wanted to use a thumbs up
          for a "like" button, then in that button's class you would say <code>class="fas fa-thumbs-up"</code>. In FreeCodeCamp they make you use the "i" element or the "span" element and nest 
          it with in the button with the text. I have no idea why they make you do it this way, the other way seems to work just fine.
        </li>

        <li>"target" is a class that is used to select something with jQuery.</li>

        <li>It's common for devs to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable or unchangeable values and lowercase/camelCase for mutable/changeable values (objects or arrays).</li>

        <li>When using camelCase, make sure to all the letters in an akronim, none of them can be lowercase. This is what's called "Best Practices".</li>

      <h4>jQuery notes</h4>

      <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes everything about using JS easier including AJAX. It has a simple to use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
        <br>
        jQuery functions often select a specific element with a "selector" and then do things to that element. For example, to make a button(s) bounce, you can use the function 
        "$("button").addClass("animated bounce");". Note that the "button" element was mentioned in the first section of the function, also note the use of camel case in the middle of the function
        and that there was no dash between the words "animated" and "bounce". Also note that the camel case piece is the ".addClass()" function, so we added CSS classes to the respective element(s)
        as well.
      </p>

      <li>All jQuery functions start with an "$". Usually this is referred to the "dollar sign operator" or "bling".</li>

      <li>"$(document).ready(function()) {});" is a jQuery function that prevents any JS code from being executed before the web page is ready/fully rendered, hense the "document" and "ready".</li>

      <li>".addClass()" is a jQuery function that adds CSS class(es) to any applied elements.</li>

      <li>Note that when classes are targeted they start with a period just like in CSS.</li>

      <li>Another example of a jQuery function would be "$(".well").addClass("animated shake");" which targets all elements with the class "well" and adds the CSS classes "animated" and "shake"
        with the ".addClass()" function.
      </li>
