        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains informatino about the webpage (meta data).</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user (semantic code).</li>

          <li>"Element" refers to the entire element. For example, from the opening to the closing of a semantic element.</li>

          <li>"Tag" refers to the letters or numbers held within the element brackets i.e. the "li" for the "list item" element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>HTML Elements</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>"meta" is the tag used to place information in the head of the webpage so that the browser can use that information to render the page. The "meta" info is also useful for 
            SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
          </li>

          <li>"header" is a semantic html element that is used to introduce the webpage and provide a navigation menu.</li>

          <li>"main" is a semantic html element that is used to contain the core content of the page.</li>

          <li>"div" is the tag for the element that is used to create a container to group content so that it can be easily styled with CSS. 
            It does nothing semantic until it is styled. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"> Here's a link to an example of its use.</a></li>

          <li>"a" is the tag for" the "anchor" element. This element has many attributes that may be used with it, a link to a list of them is in the "href" list item. 
            When you click the link, just scroll down.</li>

          <li>"table" is the tag that is used to create a table feature in the web page. It has multiple distinct sub tags related to it.
            Two of those being the "thead", "/thead" and the "tbody", "/tbody". These are used to create the head and body of the table feature respectively.
            Sub to the previous two are the "tr", "/tr" the "th", "/th" and the "td", "/td". The "tr" is to create each individual row for the table. 
            The "th" is to create the headding for each column in the table. And finally "td" is to create the spot where the actual data goes (it stands for "table data").
          </li>

          <li>"form" is the tag that is used to create spaces where the webpage can ask users for information and the users can interact with the page by providing said information.
            There are several subtags that can be used with the "form" tag: 
            "label", "/label" to say which information you are asking for, <br> "input" ("input" elements are self closing) which is used with an attribute or two to declare the type of information that is going to be recieved
            (those attributes being "type=" and "name="), <br> "textarea" gives the user a larger space to input information (a section for user complaints for example), <br>
            "select" is used with the tag "option" to provide the user with choices (there is a single choice given for each "option" tag used), 
            "input" can be used to create a button within the form if you use the "type="submit"" attribute and value
            (example: sumbition button for when you're done filling it out). Each of these tags is to be used in conjunction with the attributes "type", "name",
             and "value" which are used to designate
            types of data thusly where the data will be sent and processed ("type"), how each of the categories are labeled for the end user ("value"), and adds a designation for a server side 
            program to grab onto ("name").
          </li>

          <li>"button" creates a button separate from a form or anything else. In order for the "button" element to actually do anything it needs to be connected to some sort of JavaScript.S</li>

          <li>"img" designates an image that you would like to show on the web page, it has to be used with the "src=" attribute to find the designated image.
            It should also be used with the attribute "alt=" which makes it so if the image doesn't appear for some reason, you atleast know what was supposed to be there
            (this also helps with Search Engine Optimization). Example: "img src="some.url" alt="some image" " The "img" element is self closing.
          </li>

          <li>"Blockquote" is used mainly for quotes and creates padding around a set of text. This uses an attribute called "cite=" which is used to show the source of the quote.
            It only shows the citation material in the source code. 
          </li>

          <li>"abbr" is used to show the non abbreviated form of something that is abbreviated when you hover over the abbreviated material. It does this when used in conjunction with 
            the attribute "title=". The abbreviation is placed between the beginning part of the element and the end, like in the anchor element ("a").
          </li>

          <li>"cite" is the tag that is used to italicize bits of info to show that that info is being cited as a source for a set of info on the webpage.
            It is semantic to let the browser know that that source material is being cited.
          </li>

          <li>"figure" lets you associate an image with a caption. To use it properly you have to nest an image within the "figure" element and then use the next element on the list.</li>

          <li>"figcaption" adds a caption to an image.</li>

          <li>"fieldset" adds a sectioned of portion to the webpage.</li>

          <li>"textarea" has the same properties as an "input" element with the "type" attribute "text", but you can put more text into it and can do multiple lines of text. This element
            requires a closing tag. To enlarge the "textarea" element, use the "row" and "cols" attributes which affect the height and length respectively.
          </li>

          <li>"span" is a generic inline container used to designate a bit of text or part of a document for mark up with css more easliy.</li>

          <li>"legend" is used to create a caption for the content of its parent filedset element.</li>

          <li>"fieldset" is an element that is used to create a visually separate space from the rest of the webpage. It functions as a visual container, so-to-speak. </li>

          <li>"label" is used to semantically denote a "form" sub/child element and should always be explicitly linked with the input that it labels. This is done by giving the "input" an "id"
            and then giving the "label" a "for" attribute that is identical to the value of the "id".
          </li>

          <li>"caption" is an element that is used to caption "table" elements. It must be the first child of each respective "table" element.</li>

          <li>"thead" is the element that creates the header section of a "table" element.</li>

          <li>"tbody" is the element that creates the main portion of the "table" element that will hold most of the information.</li>

          <li>"tr" is the element that creates a row in a "table" elemnt. In order to use it you have to nest it inside a "tbody" or "thead" element, which its self will be a child of the "table"
            element.
          </li>

          <li>"td" is the element that creates a data cell within the "tr" element, so naturally it is a child of the "tr" element when in application.</li>

          <li>"th" is the element that creates a header cell for each data cell.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>

        <ul>

        <li>GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES: These are attributes that can be used with all HTML element. 
          Any element in this list will have a (GA) by the statement of its tag to show that it is one.</li>

        <li>"charset" is an attribute that is used to tell the browser how to render the lettering and numbers on a page.</li>

        <li>"action" is used to specify where form data from a webpage will be sent to the server when submitted.</li>

        <li>"method" is used to specify how to send form data from the webpage to the server. 
          For example: "method="get" makes it so form-data can be sent via a GET request. Same can be done for a POST request.
        </li>

        <li>"content" is an attribute typically used in a "meta" tag. It can be used to tell the browser how to fill the screen with the page. 
          Example: "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" " is how you tell the browser to fill the *whole* screen of any device with the web page.</li>

        <li>"href" is the tag for an attribute that is generally only used with the "anchor" element. 
          The href attribute allows a link to be connected to a bit of text or an image, etc. that is contained within the "anchor" element.
        <a href="https://html.com/attributes/a-href/">Here is a guide to its use and some examples.</a></li>

        <li>"target" is an attribute that can be used with the "href" attribute within the anchor (has the "a" tag) element, to open a link in a new window. To do this you need to give it 
          a value of "_blank".
        </li>

        <li>"type" is used with the "input" element and shows what type of data the browser should expect. If it isn't specified the browser defaults to text. Different things can happen 
          on the webpage based on the type of data the browser is expecting.The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain.
          The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. 
          <br>
          To make a submition button, use the "input" element and specify the type as "submit". To add text to it that identifies it to the user give it a "value" of "submit".
        </li>

        <li>"required" is an attribute used to make an input required to fill out or activate to be able to submit a form. There is no value to be added to this attribute 
          so it doesn't have an equal sign with quotes.
        </li>

        <li>"minlength" is an attribute that is used to ensure that a password has atleast a certain number of digits.</li>

        <li>"pattern" is used to specify a given pattern that is provided in its value portion. Ex: 
          <br> 
          [a-z0-5]{8,}.

          Given, is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.
        </li>

        <li>"name" is used to specify a name for an html attribute and can be used to reference the element for JavaScript. It can show that two radio/checkboxes/other are related so that you
           can't check both at the same time if you give them the same name.</li>

        <li>When using form elements like "label" and "input" or "select"+"option" you need to link the label with the actual form with attributes "for" (used in the label element)
          and "id" used in the "input" or "select"+"option" tags.
        </li>

        <li>"class" is used to give an element a designation that can be used to target it with a css selector. The designations given by "class" attributes are typically not unique to that
           element. You can use multiple words with spaces between to enable targeting of that element by different css rules at the same time. Example: "<"div"> class="big text""" </li>

        <li>"id" is used to give an element a unique designation that can be used to target it with a css selector.</li>

        <li>"content"  is an attribute of the "meta" element and is used to set the meta information in an HTML document.
           This can be the information for the description or the keywords, for name attribute.  </li>

        <li>"rel" shows the relationship between a linked resource (page/picture/css file) and the current document.</li>

        <li>"role" is an attribute that is used to define the purpose for an element which is useful for assistive technologies. It's part of the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative).
          Example: "section role="region /section".

        </li>

        <li>"aria-labelledby" is an attribute that identifies an element that is being used to label another element. For example, you can use a heading to label a section with "h2", id it
          as "someid" and then in the parent element you can use the "aria-labelledby" attribute to refer to that by giving it the same value as the id.
        </li>

        <li>"aria-hidden" is an attribute that indicates that the element and all of its children are to be hidden from the user and screen readers but readable to the browser.</li>

        <li>"placeholder" is an attribute that is used to show that you can type in a text box. When the user starts typing, the text disappears. Using this is not best practice though, as the user
          can confuse the "placeholder" text as an existing input and believe the section is already filled out.
        </li>

        <li>"accesskey" is an attribute that is used to link keyboard shortcuts to the webpage. Their use is not always advised.</li>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <h4>HTML 5 Semantic Tags/Elements</h4> 

        <br>

        <p>

          There are different tags/elements that are used to construct a layout of a website. Their meaning and use is self evident for the most part.

        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>

          <li>"header" creates a header for the webpage which can contain a title for the page, logo, social media links and other such things.</li>

          <li>"footer" creates a footer for the webpage which can contain links to other resources, help pages, licensing information, etc..</li>

          <li>"aside" creates a section off to the side of the web page's other main body sections ("section" and "article") and could contain side bar content. </li>

          <li>"section" is where the main content of the site goes (as I understand it)</li>

          <li>"article" goes underneath the "section" and can contain further information like things from your blog.</li>

          <li>"nav" contains the navigation bar for the website (not the webpage because you don't need to navigate to a page you're already on). It is placed just below the header and above
            the "section" and "aside" parts.</li>

          <p>If you want a colored border for an element you have to use css, first to set the width of the border then the color. Every element has a an innate border from the start.</p>

          



        </ul>
    
    </section>
    
    <section class="card" id="css-section">

      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is what is used to decorate a webpage</li>

        <li>CSS tags don't require any type of bracket around them for them to qualify as a rule (element equivolent in CSS).</li>
          
        <li>To use CSS simply state the tag (what's inside an HTML element's brackets) of the HTML element and any attributes added to that CSS element will be applied to the HTML element.
          Any attributes added to a CSS element will be placed with in the confines of a set of curly brackets/braces ie. these things: {}.</li>

          <li>Rules in CSS can be applied to multiple different CSS elements at once. This is done by stating an element, adding a comma, then stating the next element. 
            This can be done with infinitely many CSS elements. 
            When the comma(s) has been added beween the CSS elements, the attribute(s) to be applied to them can be written like normal (like for a single element). 
            Be sure to place the separate CSS elements on different line (ie. row 68, then 69) to aid in legibility.</li>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>

        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>

        <li><a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">A collection of CSS resources for beginners.</a></li>

        <p>Within CSS there are some things that use units (like meters in physics).</p>

        <li>"vh" is one of these and it stands for viewport height. 1vh is equivalent to 1% of the height of the viewport. 100vh is 100% the height of the viewport.  </li>

        <li>"rem" stands for "root em" (root element) and relats the font size to the size of the root html element.</li>

        <li>"vw" stands for "view port width" and makes it so the specified element will only take up so much of the screen. For example, 60vw would make an element take up 60% of the screen.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>CSS Elements (Called Rules), Declarations and Properties</h4>

      

      <p>Rules are used to designate/declare an element to apply changes to, properties are the changes that are applied. Selectors are the first characters with in a rule, they state which
        element you wish to affect with the css rule. If you want to target a child element within a parent element, first state the parent element then the child, separating them with a space.
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/anatomy" id="anatomyLink">An article about the anatomy of a CSS rule</a> </p>

      <ul>

        <li>Attribute selectors are what is used to select an html element based on a given attribute that it contains. For example, "input[name="password"]" is a css selector
          for any input element with the name "name="password" " attribute inside it.
        </li>

        <li>CSS elements are called "rules".</li>

        <li>The CSS selector is what could be considered the equivolent of an HTML tag. It is the declarative item that starts the "rule". 
          For example, to apply color to an HTML heading of size one (h1), the "rule" starts with the CSS selector "h1".</li>

        <li>"*" means "all elements". It applies its self to all semantic (means to be seen) HTML elements on an HTML document. 
          So if there are any attributes within this CSS element, those attributes will be applied to every HTML element in the HTML document.</li>

        <li>Class and id selectors can be used to select certain child elements within a parent element. 
          <br> This can be don by simply stating the class/id the element is attributed to and then (using a space to separate the two) stating the tag of the element that you wish to affect. 
          <br>Just like normally selecting a singular element.</li>

        <li>Inorder to use multiple class and Id selectors in a single rule, you have to separate each on by a comma AND a space.</li>

        <li></li>

      </ul>    

        <ul>

          

         


        </ul>

          <h4>CSS Properties</h4>

        <p>Properties in CSS are the parts of the CSS rules that make the rule do something. For example, if you wanted to make the background color for some html element black,
          you'd have to use the property "background-color" with in the CSS rule and set the property's value to black.</p>

        <br>

        <p>You can use parts of very specific properties as values with their respective shorthands. For example, "border-left-style" (chooses type of border) is a very specific property and cannot do the same thing as another,
          equally specific property such as "border-left-width" (chooses pixel thickness of border). To get around using multiple propertys you can use the  "border-left" property to 
          style and designate the width of the border at the same time.
        </p>


        <ul>

          <li>"margin" is a value that effects the distance from one element to another. It can be set with pixels or percentages (these percentages are measured by the distance from
            one end of the parent element to another as this can only affect child elements). When using the shorthand "margin" you affect all sides of the element ("margin-top",
            "margin-bottom", "margin-left", and "margin-right"). If you put two values in for the "margin" shorthand then the first value will effect the top/bottom and the second will do the 
            left/right. 
          </li>

          <li>"margin: 0 auto;" is a good way to center an element.</li>

          <li>"padding" again, indicates how much space you want on the inside of an element, this can produce the same result as using "margin" on a child element. "padding" is also
            shorthand that applies the value given to it to all "padding" derivitives ("padding-top","padding-bottom", "padding-right", "padding-left").
          </li>

          <li>"overflow" tells how things should be styled when content overflows the parent element box.</li>

          <li>"unset" can be used to get rid of a particular setting that you don't want for a specific element but is being applied globally for a page.</li>

          <li> "border-left-width" is used to make the left side of an element's border thicker than the other three sides.
          </li>

          <li>Changing the type of border (dotted, dashed, etc.) requires the use of the "border-left-style" property, which only styles the left side of an element's border to solid black by
            default.
          </li>

          <li><p>The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:

            box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;
            Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work:
            
            both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units
            a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
            a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
            if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change.</p></li>

            <li>Blur radius is another value of a shadow property. It blurs the edges of a shadow so that it LOOKS like a shadow. You enter a third variable value in the shadow to use this.</li>

            <li>Spread radius is another value of a shadow property/property that expands the footprint of the shadow. It is the fourth optional variable value in the shadow property.
              Like blur radius, spread radius defaults to zero if not specified.
            </li>

            <li>"display" specifies the type of rendering behavior (type of box model) of an html element. </li>

            <li>"flex-direction" is a property that changes how html elements are displayed. Example: "flex-direction: row-reverse;" will cause the elements to be displayed in reverse order
              in a row. "flex-direction: column-reverse;" will cause them to be displayed in a column in reverese order aswell.
            </li>

            <li>"flex-wrap" determines how "flex" items will behave when  they run out of room on the screen. Example: "flex-wrap: wrap;" will cause them to "wrap" into the next row or column.
              Whether it is a row or column they wrap into is specified by the "flex-direction" property.
            </li>

            <li>"justify-content" determins how items in a flex container are positioned along the main axis of the flex container. As in how it distributes space between
               and around content items along the main axis of a flex container and the inline axis of a grid container. Example: "justify-content: center;"
                moves everything to the middle of the webpage. Example: "justify-content: space-between;"  Distribute items evenly. The first item is flush with the start, 
                the last is flush with the end. So it will space out two elements as much as possible, one flush with the left side of the parent element and one flush with the right side
                of the parent element.
            </li>

            <li>"align-items" determins how items in a flex container are positioned along the cross axis of the respective element. 
              The direction of the cross axis is determined by the flex-box'a "flex-direction" property. Example: "align-items: center;" moves everything to the middle. 
            NOTE: in order to use this property the element its self that is in question needs to have been made/declared to be a flex container/flexbox.</li>

            <li>"filter" is a function that targets the applied element and can blur it. Example: "filter: blur(1px)" will blur the the element's pixels by one.</li>

            <li>"border-radius" is used to round the corners of a given element. Example: "border-radius: 9px". Different sets of corners can be altered different amounts by number placement.
              Example: "border-radius: 9x 2px;" where the first number alters the top left and bottom right corners and the second alters the top right and the bottom left corners. 
              This property can accept up to four values. Then the order is top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left.
            </li>

            <li>"border" is a property that allows you to customize the nature of the border of any element. For example, "border: 2px dotted #fff" will create a two pixel thick, white dotted line
              around any element.
            </li>

            <li>"border-(insert side here)-color" will change the color of the border on that specific side.</li>

            <li>"border-style" is a property that is used to designate the style of the border, like if you want it "solid" or not.</li>

            <li>"border-collapse" sets whether or not cells with in a table have their own borders or share them. The value "collapse" will make them share borders, while the value "separate"
              will cause them to have their own borders and a small space in between them.
            </li>
  
            <li>"box-shadow" is used to give an element the appearance of having a shadow. Example;"border-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px yellow".</li>
  
            <li>"transform" is a property that can be used to move an element in different ways like rotating the entire thing counter clockwise. Example: "transform: rotate(-0.6deg)"
              Note the negative sign for "counter".
            </li>
  
            <li>"object-fit" is a property that is used to make an "img" element to behave in a specific way. Example: "object-fit: cover;" will make the img element fill the container while 
              maintaining its aspect ratio, making it crop its self to fit. Use this to fix distorted pictures with in a container.</li>
  
            <li>"gap" is a css shorthand property that sets the gaps (aka gutters) between rows and columns. Example: "gap: 16px;" will cause a gap between columns and rows.
               It's sub properties are row-gap and column-gap. </li>

            <li>"font-family" is a property that is used to designate the desired font for a webpage. The font types can be listed with in the property. Any font name with a space in it 
              must be wrapped in quotes for css. Example: "font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif". 
            </li>

            <li>"font-size" is a property that is used to designate the desired font size for a webpage or selected element. The size can be given in units like pixels (px) or percentage of the
              given element.
            </li>

            <li>"font-style" is a property that is used to change how the font of a certain region of text looks. For example, you could use it to make the text italicized with
              "font-style: italic;"
            </li>

            <li>"box-sizing" is a property that specifies any box to have a specific value applied to it. Example: "box-sizing: border-box;" corrects the size of the box in the browser to the size of its 
              borders, excluding the padding and thickness of the border.
            </li>

            <li>"font-weight" refers to the boldness of an element's text.</li>

            <li>"letter-spacing" is a property that can be used to adjust the space between each character/letter of text in an element.</li>

            <li>"width" is a property that can be used to scale an element to the desired width of its parent element or webpage. You can set a max width for a set of elements by declaring that
              element type and using the "width" property to set it. Example: "element {width: max(250px 20vw)}". "vw" = viewport width.
            </li>

            <li>"aspect-ratio" is a property that determines the aspect ratio of an element/image. Example: "aspect-ratio: 35 / 4;". Note the use of spaces between the numbers and the slash.</li>

            <li>"text-decoration" is a property that allows you to alter semantic textual elements. For example, you can get rid of an underline on a set of text by using "text-decoration: none".
              
            <li>"cursor" is used with ":hover" to change the cursor to something other than the mouse arrow when you hover it over an element. Example: "button:hover {cursor: pointer;}" will
              change the mouse arrow to the pointer hand.
            </li>

            <li>"top" is a css property that designates the distance a particular element is from the top of the page. If you want to make something stay at the top of a page you simply have to
              give this property a value of 0.</li>

            <li>"list-style" is a css property that allows you to directly change the styling of a "li" element. For example, if you want to remove the dots from an unordered list element,
              and replace it with nothing then you can just do "list-style: none;".
            </li>

            <li>"scroll-behavior" is a property that is used to change how links that are used to navigate the local page effect the screen of the user. Using the "smooth" value for this
              property makes the computer scroll to the linked section of the webpage instead of instantly jumping to that location as is default. This helps the user not to be disoriented. </li>

            <li>"caption-side" is a CSS property that is able to move the HTML "caption" elements around to their desired locations. The "caption" element is mainly for use with the "table"
              element.
            </li>

            <li>"clip" is a property that is used to define the visible portions of an element.</li>

            <li>"clip-path" sets a "clipping region" which determines which part of an element should be shown. Where parts inside the region are shown, parts outside aren't.</li>

            <li>"white-space" is a property that is used to change how white spaces inside an element are handled. For example, if there are lots of words in an element and you want to make them
              all be in one line instead of a multi-line paragraph you could use: "white-space: nowrap;". If you want them in a paragraph you use "whit-space: normal;"
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space">Click here to learn with a demo.</a>
            </li>

            <li>"position" tells whether an element should move from its original position either when the page is scrolled through or just passively by default. It can be used to cause an 
              element to "stick" to the top or bottom of the screen when scrolling past the element. For example, you would type this phrase to make it stick at the top of the screen when scrolling
              downwards: "position: sticky;", then "top: 0;". This will make the element stick at the very top of the screen with no gap between it and the edge, hence the "0".
              <br>
              Setting "position" to "absolute" allows you to take the element it's being applied to out of the top down rendering order flow and do with it what you want. Elements in html are 
              rendered in a top-down order, as in, if they are the first elements written in a parent then they will be rendered at the top of the parent. Using "position: absolute;" can change
              where on the page they appear. This is how the Free Code Cample put it: 
              <br>
              Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position property.

Set the position property for the #back-wall element to absolute. An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. Set the #back-wall element to have a top value of 0, and a left value of 0.
            </li>

            <li>"!important" is a VALUE that you can give to any property that you can use to make sure a rule is applied to an element regardless of execution order or specificity.
              For example, "position: absolute !important" is how you would write it.
            </li>

            <li>"top" is a property that allows you to say how close or far you want a child from/to the top of the parent. Example: 
              "top: -2.25rem" will move the child closer to the top of the parent the greater the size of the negative number, while a positive number will do the opposite.
              There are other properties that are just like this but they have to do with each respective side of the screen and are named accordingly. If you use a percentage with this 
              property, it will interpret the percentage as meaning "10% from the top of the parent element", and that's the same with all other "side designating properties".
            </li>

            <li>"vertical-align" is a property that is used to move a child element up or down within the parent element. For example it can be used to place text at the top of the parent
              with this: "vertical-align: top;". 
              <br>
              There is no "horizontal-align"?
            </li>

            <li>"z-index" is a property that is used to create layers for your HTML elements. I.e. a "vertical axis" by which they can be aligned, think z-axis like in math. 
              Elements with a higher "z-index" value will appear to be layered on top of other elements.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>At-rules</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>"@media" is an at-rule that has a feature called "prefers-reduced-motion" which is used to modify CSS rules based on the user's preferences. It takes one of the following values:
            "reduce", and "no-preference". It is wrapped around an existing selector with the existing selector sort of functioning like the declaration part of the rule (property and property
            value). Example: 
            <br>
            "@media (feature: value) {
              selector {
                styles
              }
            }"
          </li>

        </ul>
      
        <h4>CSS Color Methods</h4>

        <p>There are various ways to implement colors into your website with CSS. You can use the rgb/rgba value scheme, hex colors, hsl/hsla color functions, the hwb color function, named colors
          and transparent keywords. For better information refer to the projects in the feecodecamp css module "CSS Color Markers" steps 50 and onwards. </p>

          <br>

        <p></p>

        

        

        <ul>
          
          <li>Hex color code is a type of color designation that uses three sets of two figures that aren't separated by spaces or commas. Format: "000000". All zeros means black all f's means white.
            The first two figures are for red, the second are for green, and the last two are for blue.
          </li>

          <li>RGB color code is another way to designate colors. It is comprised of a set of three neumerical figures that are separated by commas and spaces. Format: "0, 0, 0". All zeros means 
            black. The highest value able to be put in each spot is 255, which maxes out the color that is added, so "255, 0, 0" would be as red as possible. All values set at 255 will make white.  </li>

          <li>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. It has three values that need to be filled out, the first one (hue) is just a number, the next two (saturation and lightness 
            respectively) are percentages. Format: "185, 16%, 50%". The "hue" designates the color that is to be used and the rest are descriptors detailing how much and how intense. 
          </li>

          <li>Color-stops are values that you put at the end of a functions color value ('linear gradiant (90deg, rgb (255, 0, 0) 75%) where the color stop is the percentage value). The way this 
          is written will make the color red occupy 75% of the spectrum that the property 'background' with the function 'linear gradiant' creates.</li>

          <li>Opacity is a property that is used to make things see-through.It is stated as a decimal value that equates to percentages. 0 is equal to 0% and 1.0 is 100%.
             The default for any element is to make it completely opaque (1.0).
          </li>

          <li>Alpha Channel: The Alpha Channel is another way to deal with opacity. When using it you add a name to the color function that you are using, namely "a". Example: "rgba". 
            Adding this extra "a" to the end of rgb adds a decimal value (that's equivalent to a percentage value) to the end of the function. Example: (0, 0, 0, 0.5). This can be used with
            hsl and hex colors (just adds another pair of figures to the end of a hex value just like the rest).

          </li>



        </ul>

      <h4>CSS functions</h4>

      <p>A CSS function is used within a property and is used to affect the way the value is displayed by the CSS property. For example: 'linear-gradient' is a function that can 
        be used with the property 'background' to change how the colors are displayed in the background of the element. It creates a spectrum from one color to the other and can only be used
        with two or more colors. The color values put in the function don't have to be a specific format, they just have to be colors that can be rendered.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>'linear-gradient' is a function that is used to create a spectrum from one color to another. You can choose how this spectrum is oriented with the gradient direction arguement (data piece).
          It can be oriented in any direction, left-right, up-down, or kitty corner based on whether you input anything from 0degs to 359degs (360 is the same as putting 0 because it's like a color wheel).
        </li>

        <li>"calc()" is a function that lets you calculate a value based on other values. For example, you can use it to calculate the width of the viewport minus the margin of an element:
          ".example {
            margin: 10px;
            width: calc(100% - 20px);
          }"
          This is good for running a webpage on multiple types of devices with different screen sizes because it automatically adjusts the elements to take up a set amount ("2px" or whatever) 
          of horizontal (only the case for this application) of the parent element.
        </li>

        

      </ul>

      <h4>CSS selectors</h4>

        <p>Selectors are basically just stating the tag of the html elements that you're targeting over again. Unless they are class, id, "*", or others.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Id selectors are just the name of the id proceeded by a "#" with no spaces.</li>

        <li>Class selectors are just the name of the class proceeded by a "." with no spaces.</li>

        <li>">" is a selector that is used to target a child element of a parent element. Example: "nav > ul {}". When targetting multiple elements inside a single parent element, state the parent
          twice and each child once. For example if you have a parent called ".info" and the children are "label" and "input" you do this: ".info > label, .info > input", or
          ".info label, .info input". Note the use of a comma in both declarations.
        </li>

        <li>Another way the ">" effect in CSS can be replicated to an extant by merely using the indivdual tags in their appropriate order of execution. For example, "A" is the parent element 
          of "B" so when you wish to specify "B" in the CSS rule's declaration portion, you merely have to first state "A" then "B" with a space in between.
          <br>
          To target a specific element and the rest of the elements in a parent with a CSS rule at the same time you can use something like this: "footer, footer a". Where "footer" is the parent
          and "a" is a specific child of that element. 
        </li>

        <li>To target any child element with a certain attribute, regardless of the attributes value you can use this syntax: "#years span[class]{}". The "span" is the type of element being targeted,
          the "class" is the type of attribute being targeted, and the "#years" the id of the parent.
        </li>

        <li>Targeting any element with a specific attribute that has a certain value can be done with a selector written in the format: 
          "elementTag[attribute="value"]". A specific example would be like this: "tr[class="total"]", where "tr" is the table row element, "class" is the assigned class attribute and "total"
        is the assigned class attribute's value. 
      <br>
          Taking that even further, you can target a child element within the parent with "parent[attribute="value"] child".
      <br>
      The key difference between "tr[class="total"]"" and "tr.total" is that the first will select "tr" elements where the only
       class is "total". The second will select "tr" elements where the class includes "total".
        </li>

        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php">More CSS selector notations can be found here.</a>Many of these selector notations are for selecting multiple elements
        or selecting elements based on their classes or id's.</li>

        <li>Selecting an element with a certain class that is its self inside a child element can take the form of something like this: "parent.parentclass child .child'sChildclass". 
          Here is the example used in the FreeCodeCamp course: 
          <br>
          "Create a tr.data th .description selector to target the elements with the class set to description that are within your th
           elements in your .data table rows. Give them a block display, make the text italic with a normal weight, and position them with a padding set to 1rem 0 0.75rem and a right margin of
            -13.5rem.""
        </li>



      </ul>

      <h4>Pseudo-selectors</h4>

      <p>A pseudo-selector is a keyword that specifies a certain state that the selected element can be in. For example, when a user hovers their mouse over a link that link can change color.
        The mouse hovering over the link is the state that is being reffered to, when it is in that state (possibly about to be selected) it changes color but only then for that specific
        pseudo-selector.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>":hover" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you hover your mouse over it.</li>

        <li>":active" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you click it.</li>

        <li>":visited" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color after you've used it.</li>

        <li>":after" is a psuedo-selector that creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. Example: ".gallery:after {}" is how you use it.</li>

        <li>":not" is a psuedo-selector that can be used to select all elements that don't correspond with a certain Id or class attribute. Ex: "div:not(#example) {}" will apply the css 
          properties the css rule contains to any element that doesn't have an Id of "example". </li>

        <li>":before" is a pseudo-selector that can be used to create a pseudo-element that is the FIRST child of the selected element. It's mainly used to add cosmetic content to an element
          by using the "content" property. This pseudo-element that is created is in-line by default.
        </li>

        <li>":last-of-type" is a pseudo-selector that is used to target the last child in a parent element.</li>

        <li>":first-of-type" is a pseudo-selector that is used to target the first child in a parent element.</li>

        <li>":nth-of-type()" is a psuedo-selector that is used to target specific child elements within the parent based on their order among siblings of the same type.</li>

        

      </ul>

      <p>SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics is an image format that is used for two dimenstional images/graphics and has support for interactivity and animation.
        Scalable Vector Graphics contain a "path" attribute that allows the image to be scaled to the webpage without affecting the resolution of the resultant image. </p>
