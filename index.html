        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains informatino about the webpage (meta data).</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user (semantic code).</li>

          <li>"Element" refers to the entire element. For example, from the opening to the closing of a semantic element.</li>

          <li>"Tag" refers to the letters or numbers held within the element brackets i.e. the "li" for the "list item" element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>HTML Elements</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>"div" is the tag for the element that is used to create a container to group content so that it can be easily styled with CSS. 
            It does nothing semantic until it is styled. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"> Here's a link to an example of its use.</a></li>

          <li>"a" is the tag for" the "anchor" element. This element has many attributes that may be used with it, a link to a list of them is in the "href" list item. 
            When you click the link, just scroll down.</li>

          <li>"table" is the tag that is used to create a table feature in the web page. It has multiple distinct sub tags related to it.
            Two of those being the "thead", "/thead" and the "tbody", "/tbody". These are used to create the head and body of the table feature respectively.
            Sub to the previous two are the "tr", "/tr" the "th", "/th" and the "td", "/td". The "tr" is to create each individual row for the table. 
            The "th" is to create the headding for each column in the table. And finally "td" is to create the spot where the actual data goes (it stands for "table data").
          </li>

          <li>"form" is the tag that is used to create spaces where the webpage can ask users for information and the users can interact with the page by providing said information.
            There are several subtags that can be used with the "form" tag: 
            "label", "/label" to say which information you are asking for, <br> "input" ("input" elements are self closing) which is used with an attribute or two to declare the type of information that is going to be recieved
            (those attributes being "type=" and "name="), <br> "textarea" gives the user a larger space to input information (a section for user complaints for example), <br>
            "select" is used with the tag "option" to provide the user with choices (there is a single choice given for each "option" tag used), 
            "input" can be used to create a button within the form if you use the "type="submit"" attribute and value
            (example: sumbition button for when you're done filling it out). Each of these tags is to be used in conjunction with the attributes "type", "name",
             and "value" which are used to designate
            types of data thusly where the data will be sent and processed ("type"), how each of the categories are labeled for the end user ("value"), and adds a designation for a server side 
            program to grab onto ("name").
          </li>

          <li>"button" creates a button separate from a form or anything else. In order for the "button" element to actually do anything it needs to be connected to some sort of JavaScript.S</li>

          <li>"img" designates an image that you would like to show on the web page, it has to be used with the "src=" attribute to find the designated image.
            It should also be used with the attribute "alt=" which makes it so if the image doesn't appear for some reason, you atleast know what was supposed to be there
            (this also helps with Search Engine Optimization).
          </li>

          <li>"Blockquote" is used mainly for quotes and creates padding around a set of text. This uses an attribute called "cite=" which is used to show the source of the quote.
            It only shows the citation material in the source code. 
          </li>

          <li>"abbr" is used to show the non abbreviated form of something that is abbreviated when you hover over the abbreviated material. It does this when used in conjunction with 
            the attribute "title=". The abbreviation is placed between the beginning part of the element and the end, like in the anchor element ("a").
          </li>

          <li>"cite" is the tag that is used to italicize bits of info to show that that info is being cited as a source for a set of info on the webpage.
            It is semantic to let the browser know that that source material is being cited.
          </li>

          <li>"figure" lets you associate an image with a caption. To use it properly you have to nest an image within the "figure" element and then use the next element on the list.</li>

          <li>"figcaption" adds a caption to an image.</li>

          <li>"fieldset" adds a sectioned of portion to the webpage.</li>

          <li>"textarea" has the same properties as an "input" element with the "type" attribute "text", but you can put more text into it and can do multiple lines of text. This element
            requires a closing tag. To enlarge the "textarea" element, use the "row" and "cols" attributes which affect the height and length respectively.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>

        <ul>

        <li>GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES: These are attributes that can be used with all HTML element. 
          Any element in this list will have a (GA) by the statement of its tag to show that it is one.</li>

        <li>"href" is the tag for an attribute that is generally only used with the "anchor" element. 
          The href attribute allows a link to be connected to a bit of text or an image, etc. that is contained within the "anchor" element.
        <a href="https://html.com/attributes/a-href/">Here is a guide to its use and some examples.</a></li>

        <li>"target" is an attribute that can be used with the "href" attribute within the anchor (has the "a" tag) element, to open a link in a new window. To do this you need to give it 
          a value of "_blank".
        </li>

        <li>"action" when used with the "form" element is used to show where form data should be sent.</li>

        <li>"method" can be used with the "form" element to say how the back end. For example: "method="get" makes it so form-data can be sent via a GET request. Same can be done for a POST request.</li>

        <li>"type" is used with the "input" element and shows what type of data the browser should expect. If it isn't specified the browser defaults to text. Different things can happen 
          on the webpage based on the type of data the browser is expecting.The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain.
          The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. 
          <br>
          To make a submition button, use the "input" element and specify the type as "submit". To add text to it that identifies it to the user give it a "value" of "submit".
        </li>

        <li>"required" is an attribute used to make an input required to fill out or activate to be able to submit a form. There is no value to be added to this attribute 
          so it doesn't have an equal sign with quotes.
        </li>

        <li>"minlength" is an attribute that is used to ensure that a password has atleast a certain number of digits.</li>

        <li>"pattern" is used to specify a given pattern that is provided in its value portion. Ex: 
          <br> 
          [a-z0-5]{8,}.

          Given, is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.
        </li>

        <li>"name" is used to show that two radio/checkboxes/other are related so that you can't check both at the same time.</li>

        <li>When using form elements like "label" and "input" or "select"+"option" you need to link the label with the actual form with attributes "for" (used in the label element)
          and "id" used in the "input" or "select"+"option" tags.
        </li>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <h4>HTML 5 Semantic Tags/Elements</h4>

        <br>

        <p>

          There are different tags/elements that are used to construct a layout of a website. Their meaning and use is self evident for the most part.

        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>

          <li>"header" creates a header for the webpage which can contain a title for the page, logo, social media links and other such things.</li>

          <li>"footer" creates a footer for the webpage which can contain links to other resources, help pages, licensing information, etc..</li>

          <li>"aside" creates a section off to the side of the web page's other main body sections ("section" and "article") and could contain side bar content. </li>

          <li>"section" is where the main content of the site goes (as I understand it)</li>

          <li>"article" goes underneath the "section" and can contain further information like things from your blog.</li>

          <li>"nav" contains the navigation bar for the website (not the webpage because you don't need to navigate to a page you're already on). It is placed just below the header and above
            the "section" and "aside" parts.</li>

          <p>If you want a colored border for an element you have to use css, first to set the width of the border then the color. Every element has a an innate border from the start.</p>

          



        </ul>
    
    </section>
    
    <section class="card" id="css-section">

      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is what is used to decorate a webpage</li>

        <li>CSS tags don't require any type of bracket around them for them to qualify as a rule (element equivolent in CSS).</li>
          
        <li>To use CSS simply state the tag (what's inside an HTML element's brackets) of the HTML element and any attributes added to that CSS element will be applied to the HTML element.
          Any attributes added to a CSS element will be placed with in the confines of a set of curly brackets/braces ie. these things: {}.</li>

          <li>Rules in CSS can be applied to multiple different CSS elements at once. This is done by stating an element, adding a comma, then stating the next element. 
            This can be done with infinitely many CSS elements. 
            When the comma(s) has been added beween the CSS elements, the attribute(s) to be applied to them can be written like normal (like for a single element). 
            Be sure to place the separate CSS elements on different line (ie. row 68, then 69) to aid in legibility.</li>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>

        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>

        <li><a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">A collection of CSS resources for beginners.</a></li>

        <p>Within CSS there are some things that use units (like meters in physics).</p>

        <li>"vh" is one of these and it stands for viewport height. 1vh is equivalent to 1% of the height of the viewport. 100vh is 100% the height of the viewport.  </li>

        <li>"rem" stands for "root em" and is related to the font size of an html element.</li>

        <li>"vw" stands for "view port width" and makes it so the specified element will only take up so much of the screen. For example, 60vw would make an element take up 60% of the screen.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>CSS Elements (Called Rules)</h4>

      

      <ul>

        <li>Attribute selectors are what is used to select an html element based on a given attribute that it contains. For example, "input[name="password"]" is a css selector
          for any input element with the name "name="password" " attribute inside it.
        </li>

        <li>CSS elements are called "rules".</li>

        <li>The CSS selector is what could be considered the equivolent of an HTML tag. It is the declarative item that starts the "rule". 
          For example, to apply color to an HTML heading of size one (h1), the "rule" starts with the CSS selector "h1".</li>

        <li>"*" means "all elements". It applies its self to all semantic (means to be seen) HTML elements on an HTML document. 
          So if there are any attributes within this CSS element, those attributes will be applied to every HTML element in the HTML document.</li>

        <li>Class and id selectors can be used to select certain child elements within a parent element. 
          <br> This can be don by simply stating the class/id the element is attributed to and then (using a space to separate the two) stating the tag of the element that you wish to affect. 
          <br>Just like normally selecting a singular element.</li>

        <li>Inorder to use multiple class and Id selectors in a single rule, you have to separate each on by a comma AND a space.</li>

      </ul>    

        <ul>

          <li>"margin" is a value that effects the distance from one element to another. It can be set with pixels or percentages (these percentages are measured by the distance from
            one end of the parent element to another as this can only affect child elements). When using the shorthand "margin" you affect all sides of the element ("margin-top",
            "margin-bottom", "margin-left", and "margin-right"). If you put two values in for the "margin" shorthand then the first value will effect the top/bottom and the second will do the 
            left/right. 
          </li>

          <li>"margin: 0 auto;" is a good way to center an element.</li>

          <li>"padding" again, indicates how much space you want on the inside of an element, this can produce the same result as using "margin" on a child element. "padding" is also
            shorthand that applies the value given to it to all "padding" derivitives ("padding-top","padding-bottom", "padding-right", "padding-left").
          </li>

          <li>"overflow"</li>

        </ul>

          <h4>CSS Declarations</h4>

        <p>Declarations in CSS are the parts of the CSS rules that make the rule do something. For example, if you wanted to make the background color for some html element black,
          you'd have to use the declaration "background-color" with in the CSS rule and set the declaration's value to black.</p>

        <br>

        <p>You can use parts of very specific declarations as values with their respective shorthands. For example, "border-left-style" (chooses type of border) is a very specific declaration and cannot do the same thing as another,
          equally specific declaration such as "border-left-width" (chooses pixel thickness of border). To get around using multiple declarations you can use the  "border-left" declaration to 
          style and designate the width of the border at the same time.
        </p>


        <ul>

          <li>"unset" can be used to get rid of a particular setting that you don't want for a specific element but is being applied globally to a page for a page.</li>

          <li> "border-left-width" is used to make the left side of an element's border thicker than the other three sides.
          </li>

          <li>Changing the type of border (dotted, dashed, etc.) requires the use of the "border-left-style" declaration, which only styles the left side of an element's border to solid black by
            default.
          </li>

          <li><p>The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:

            box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;
            Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work:
            
            both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units
            a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
            a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
            if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change.</p></li>

            <li>Blur radius is another value of a shadow property. It blurs the edges of a shadow so that it LOOKS like a shadow. You enter a third variable value in the shadow to use this.</li>

            <li>Spread radius is another value of a shadow property/declaration that expands the footprint of the shadow. It is the fourth optional variable value in the shadow declaration.
              Like blur radius, spread radius defaults to zero if not specified.
            </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>CSS Color Methods</h4>

        <p>There are various ways to implement colors into your website with CSS. You can use the rgb/rgba value scheme, hex colors, hsl/hsla color functions, the hwb color function, named colors
          and transparent keywords. For better information refer to the projects in the feecodecamp css module "CSS Color Markers" steps 50 and onwards. </p>

          <br>

        <p></p>

        

        

        <ul>
          
          <li>Hex color code is a type of color designation that uses three sets of two figures that aren't separated by spaces or commas. Format: "000000". All zeros means black all f's means white.
            The first two figures are for red, the second are for green, and the last two are for blue.
          </li>

          <li>RGB color code is another way to designate colors. It is comprised of a set of three neumerical figures that are separated by commas and spaces. Format: "0, 0, 0". All zeros means 
            black. The highest value able to be put in each spot is 255, which maxes out the color that is added, so "255, 0, 0" would be as red as possible. All values set at 255 will make white.  </li>

          <li>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. It has three values that need to be filled out, the first one (hue) is just a number, the next two (saturation and lightness 
            respectively) are percentages. Format: "185, 16%, 50%". The "hue" designates the color that is to be used and the rest are descriptors detailing how much and how intense. 
          </li>

          <li>Color-stops are values that you put at the end of a functions color value ('linear gradiant (90deg, rgb (255, 0, 0) 75%) where the color stop is the percentage value). The way this 
          is written will make the color red occupy 75% of the spectrum that the declaration 'background' with the function 'linear gradiant' creates.</li>

          <li>Opacity is a declaration that is used to make things see-through.It is stated as a decimal value that equates to percentages. 0 is equal to 0% and 1.0 is 100%.
             The default for any element is to make it completely opaque (1.0).
          </li>

          <li>Alpha Channel: The Alpha Channel is another way to deal with opacity. When using it you add a name to the color function that you are using, namely "a". Example: "rgba". 
            Adding this extra "a" to the end of rgb adds a decimal value (that's equivalent to a percentage value) to the end of the function. Example: (0, 0, 0, 0.5). This can be used with
            hsl and hex colors (just adds another pair of figures to the end of a hex value just like the rest).

          </li>



        </ul>

      <h4>CSS functions</h4>

      <p>A CSS function is used within a declaration and is used to affect the way the value is displayed by the CSS declaration. For example: 'linear-gradient' is a function that can 
        be used with the declaration 'background' to change how the colors are displayed in the background of the element. It creates a spectrum from one color to the other and can only be used
        with two or more colors. The color values put in the function don't have to be a specific format, they just have to be colors that can be rendered.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>'linear-gradient' is a function that is used to create a spectrum from one color to another. You can choose how this spectrum is oriented with the gradient direction arguement (data piece).
          It can be oriented in any direction, left-right, up-down, or kitty corner based on whether you input anything from 0degs to 359degs (360 is the same as putting 0 because it's like a color wheel).
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h4>Pseudo-selectors</h4>

      <p>A pseudo-selector is a keyword that specifies a certain state that the selected element can be in. For example, when a user hovers their mouse over a link that link can change color.
        The mouse hovering over the link is the state that is being reffered to, when it is in that state (possibly about to be selected) it changes color but only then for that specific
        pseudo-selector.
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>":hover" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you hover your mouse over it.</li>

        <li>":active" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color when you click it.</li>

        <li>":visited" is the pseudo-selector that can be used to make a link change color after you've used it.</li>

        

      </ul>

        <li>JavaScript is also the code that links the front end to the back end (I think).</li>

        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

        <li>Control flow refers to how the code we input is executed by the computer. 
          For JS the control flow is top to bottom and for multi faceted variables, functions, objects, arrays and the like, it is executed left to right.</li>
