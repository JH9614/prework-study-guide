          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user (semantic code).</li>

          <li>"Element" refers to the entire element. For example, from the opening to the closing of a semantic element.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is what is used to decorate a webpage</li>

        <li>CSS elements don't require any type of bracket around them.</li>
          
        <li>To use CSS simply state the tag (what's inside an HTML element's brackets) of the HTML element and any attributes added to that CSS element will be applied to the HTML element.
          Any attributes added to a CSS element will be placed with in the confines of a set of curly brackets/braces ie. these things: {}.</li>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>

        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>Git commands are sets of commands for the CL (command line) of a computer's system. 
          They are called git commands because "Git" is the software that is used to access the command line.</li>

        <li><a href ="https://dev.classmethod.jp/articles/git-bash-commands/"> Another list of Git Bash commands for developers can be found here. </a></li>

        <li>"git status": checks what branch we are currently on.</li>

        <li>"git checkout -b branch name": creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

        <li>"git log": shows all commits that have been performed on a repo.</li>

        <h4>Git Work Flow Commands In Order</h4>

      <ol>

        <li>"git status": checks what branch we are currently on.</li>

        <li>"git add -A": stages ALL (hence the "A") the files that are yet to be staged.</li>

        <li>"git commit -m "added code to the HTML file" ": use this to commit the files that have been staged to the working branch. 
          The bit in quotes is the note describing what was done in the files.</li>

        <li>"git pull origin main": syncs the local branch you are working on with the remote branch of the same name on github. 
          It is always important to do a pull before you "push" the code into the branch of the remote repository on github. If you don't sync the branches you may be working on outdated code.</li>

        <li>"git push origin "branch/name"": this "pushes" the changes we made to the remote branch so it has a copy of what the file looks like now, replacing the old one.</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>JavaScript is a widely used language that is used by websites to handle multimedia, animated images, and create dynamically updating content.</li>

        <li>JavaScript is also the code that links the front end to the back end (I think).</li>

        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

        <li>Control flow refers to how the code we input is executed by the computer. 
          For JS the control flow is top to bottom and for multi faceted variables, functions, objects, arrays and the like, it is executed left to right.</li>
